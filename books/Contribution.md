## Contribution rules
Use these exact titles for what changes are you making
- `🧶 | Bug fixing` - Self explanatory.
- `🐀 | Code beautification` - When you delete some duplicates, add things into functions, add comments, and more things to make the code more readable!
- `📚 | Books` - When you update the `README.md` or something in `./books` directory.

If you are doing something else, use your own title.
