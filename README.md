## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1071744854616449064/1071802062603567184/image.png)

We believe that pornography is a very serious issue, studies show that it messes with your brain, especially when discovered at a young age.
We want to help people overcome their porn addictions, and improve themselves.

## How does it work

There are few ways DestroyPorn detects NSFW content. Here are the main ones:
- Checks if the website has been marked as a pornography site.
- Scans thru all the images/videos/gifs/ads on a website, and removes it right away.

### Installation

- Make sure you're running Chrome or a Chromium based browser. (Like Opera or Brave)
- Download the repository.
- Go to the extensions settings in your browser.
- Enable Developer Mode
- Click "Load unpacked" and select the unpacked .zip file you downloaded.
- Click reload and enjoy!
